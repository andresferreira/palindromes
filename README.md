 Software Challenge
 
- Solution is written in JAVA language using Apache MAVEN as a software project management tool;
- The IDE used was IntelliJ IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2.5
- Junit tests were used to verify the correctness of a program's behaviour (see PalindromesTest.java);
- File '.gitignore' was added since code should be maintainable, reusable and portable (usign git if needed for example).

TO RUN THE CODE:
1. Please use an IDE(for example IntelliJ IDEA - to download see: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/); 
2. Open the project, select pom.xml in 'Palindromes\pom.xml' path;
3. Go to PalindromesMain.java to run the program.
4. Run the main program
5. You can change input String in the field 'inputString' and run again.
6. For more details see runprogram.docx



Good:
Easy to follow readme & instructions, Non-complicated code, Reasonable number/coverage of tests
Bad:
Main “utility” class should be static and not instantiated as an object
Javadoc is half-complete, Tests are not generally focussed on the scenario / use case, instead feel a little random at times, Logic error in code, could result in more than 3 results being printed out
